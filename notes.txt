metrics
  - total cells
  - cells evaluated
  - evaluated / total
  
  ...some way of judging what's getting done in parallel
  
goals:
  - swap algorithms and data structures and see efficiency impact.
    ideally this would be a score rather than raw time measurements...
      - think query plan
      - costs are assigned to various operations - 
        - vector access
        - copy operations, etc
      - test-drive things like update-in vs assoc-in based on cost
